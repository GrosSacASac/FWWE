##Images

For most images we will use [JPEG 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000) image format with 40% compression and  rgb(0-255,0-255,0-255) (16777216 colors).  (MIME type is image/jp2)

For images with few large mono-color zones we can also use [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) image format to save space. (MIME type is image/png)

For vectorial use SVG version 1.1 or later
