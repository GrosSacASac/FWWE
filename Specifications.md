##Introduction
###Where does the idea come from ?
There are many Trading card games (TCG) out there, and while the most are fun to play there are a lot of valid critics against them. We want to make __a better card game__ that doesn't repeat horrible design decisions taken in the past. Here is a list of common mistakes amongst popular TCG. We will go trough each item to better understand it. Eventually all these problems won't be in the new card game.

###Common design mistakes

* Broken combos
* Plain useless cards
* Too much variability
* Must cards
* Obvious choices
* Limited strategies
* Pay to win

####Broken combos
A broken combo is a combination of two or more cards, with a very powerful output equivalent to the output of double that many of cards, and sometimes even more, some broken combos are even synonyms to instant win. While combination of cards are very fun to play with, broken combos just break the natural rythm of the game and make it look unfair. It's hard to define exactly what a broken combo is but here is a list to catch most of them. A combo is broken when:

* It makes you instantly win the game
* The number of cards to counter properly the combo is double the number of card to produce the combo
* The combo is very strong and all cards can be played individually with absolutely no risks of being weak cards when alone
* There is no way to separate one of the combining card with a single card
* It is easier to build the combo than destroying it
* The cards needed to counter the combo are risky to play if the combo doesn't show up

To fight such combos (because they make gameplay worse), existing card games use card-bans, card-limits, new formats where the cards are too old, stronger combos to compete with and so on. The problem with these solutions is that they do not block future broken combos, and they create new problems like useless cards for instance.

####Plain useless cards
Plain useless cards are cards that no one ever wants to put in his deck. Often these cards are very similar to others but just a bit weaker. It is a good step forward to have zero useless cards, especially beginners don't have to remember more cards for the same end-game. Also, when there are useless cards in a collection you have to manually check for each card in your deck if there is the same card in better. With zero useless cards, player will feel more in control and so happier.

####Too much variability
Variability is absolutely not avoidable, but you can always reduce it. Variability becomes a problem, when at each draw you want _that one card_, when you can loose because you draw _not the right cards_ at the beginning, or when your opponent plays his super strong card at turn 3 etc. In a balanced deck you can loose because of that in one game for twenty. Overall variability escalates very fast when the gameplay and meta are constructed on top of broken combos and must cards.

####Must cards
Musts cards are so strong, if you don't put them in your deck, it will be like shooting in your feet. In fact, must cards often destroy up to 3 enemy cards or are very cost effective. They are strong enough to make a huge difference between drawing them or not, which scales up variability very fast. In general they make all other cards look like rather weak and not strong enough to take an advantage. The big problem with these is that decks are build around must cards and not around a winning strategy.

####Obvious choices
To understand why obvious choices are a problem, you have to think about why card games are games. What produce the inside fun, is the puzzles you have to solve each turn to do the best sequence of action possible with your available resources. That said, obvious choices are for the most part existing because the puzzle you're solving is too simple __or__ because the scenario is the same as in previously played games. Must cards and useless cards results in all decks looking pretty much the same and have few variations which bring us back to obvious choices during a game.

####Limited strategies
A strategy is a plan prior action in order to win. In order to have a lot you must give the players the tools necessary and not make a strategy plain stronger than another.

####Pay to win
Actual TCG are for the most part, _pay to win_ games. You have to spend Xâ‚¬ to receive the must cards and the good combos. If you don't own the musts you just loose no matter what. For us it is very important to not become a _pay to win_ but a _"build, play, rebuild to win"_ and that's why none of the [common design mistakes](#common-design-mistakes) will be in our game.

##Functional specification
Note: This part is not finished yet (v1)

###Game
Each player starts with 35 Life, 1 main deck (45cards), 1 source deck (15 cards). To win bring opponents life to 0 or less. Each turn you draw 1 card from the main deck. You wait 2 turns to draw from the source deck. 

###Card types
Here are the card types with their attributes:

* Soldier
    * Cost
    * Title
    * Photo
    * Subtypes
    * Effects
    * Attack
    * Life
    * Speed
    * Regeneration rate

    * Photo
    * Subtypes
    * Pure
    * Effects
* Spell
    * Cost
    * Title
    * Photo
    * Subtypes
    * Effects
* Weapon
    * Cost
    * Title
    * Photo
    * Subtypes
    * Effects
    * Attack modifier
    * Life modifier
    * Speed modifier
    * Regeneration rate modifier
    * Limit

####Soldier
* __Call__: To call a soldier from your hand you must pay its cost with sources. It appears on the battlefield. You can only call a soldier during your turn.
* __Attack__: To attack with a soldier you must wait 1 turn after the call or [condition here]. You can only decide to attack the opponent and you can't target anything. You can only attack during your turn.
* __Block__: You may block a enemy soldier with 1 or more soldiers from your own. If you don't you will be hit by a direct attack
* __Direct Attack__ You loose life equal to the attack of the attacking soldier
* __Fight__: A fight is when an attacking soldier is blocked by 1 or more blocking soldiers
    1. The slowest looses life equal to the attack of the fastest. If the life goes 0 or less the soldier dies. Repeat until all remaining soldier have hit once. The slowest soldiers attack at the end
    2. Fighting soldiers return to the masters side and cant fight again until the next turn.
* __Regeneration__: At the end of each turn, All soldiers recover life points equal to their respective regeneration rate.
* __Death__: When a soldier dies, it is removed from any fight and from the battlefield and is sent to the graveyard. This occurs when it has no life points.

####Spell
* __Call__: To call a spell from your hand you must pay its cost with sources. The effects are triggered. You can only call a spell during your turn, unless its subtype is fast.
* __React__: Whenever your opponent calls a slow card you can react and call a fast spell before

####Source
Mana source allow you to pay the necessary cost for all other cards.

###Fields
Objects can be in the following fields, the number is the maximum size, number + is a minimum:

* Hand (8)
* Main Deck (45+)
* Source Deck (15)
* Graveyard
* Source field (15)
* Soldier field (10)
* Battlefield (Middle)




##Technical architecture

###Multi-player

To support multi-player we will use a dynamic server that will make the link between the two players. The same game will run simultaneously on clients (browsers) and server. Every time a player makes an action the it will be checked.

1. client-side
2. server-side if 1. passes
3. server will confirm and send message to both clients if 2. passes
4. Whenever a confirmation message is sent or received the action will take place
5. on client sides, wait for next action

That way the clients cannot make actions that are not allowed in the untouchable server rules even if they changes the local JavaScript. In fact clients will be servers too because they will wait for the other client to decide what action they do. I said that the same game will run on all machines but in reality it is wrong: The client_a will only have information about what he can see, and the server will know every cards

###Technologies and platforms

We use the combination of __modern HTML + CSS + JS__ for client side and JS+[to be decided] on server side.
That way we can distribute our game with a single URL and it will be accessible on almost any device. At first we will focus on future __desktop browser__, but later we can optimize the CSS for optimal use on Phones, tablets, tv and more.

###Inner Architecture

The core programm is separated on view and model, that means we store __all__ data essential for the game in raw JavaScript variables and perhaps we copy some of these in the DOM so that players can see their cards. Some setter on JS variables will call view setter that will change the DOM.

####Example
```
hand.receive_new_card = function(the_new_card) {
    if hand.length < hand.limit {
        hand.push(the_new_card);
        view.hand.receive_new_card(the_new_card);//show player his new card and put it in his hand 
    }
    else {
        view.hand.animation_lost_card(the_new_card);
    }
};

var draw = function() {
    newest_card = deck.pop_last();
    if newest_card {
        view.draw();
        hand.receive_new_card(newest_card);
    }
};
```
###Card manipulation

All cards are stored in static files in js/cards/soldier_cards.js and js/cards/soldier_cards.js and ...
But at the end there will be 1 big object containing all cards: var CARDS
You can access any individual card anytime with `CARDS["card_type"][number]`
You can access any individual card property anytime with `CARDS["card_type"][number]["property_key"]`

But when a card is called into the game we clone the original card into a living card who can loose live points, win attack power and so on (We wouldn't even think about modifying the original, right ?). At the end the clone will have much more properties (like attack_modifier) and will be stored in a non static collection of cards in-game called `living_cards`

To create a living card from a static card we call a function `living = living_from_original(original);`
As we store all cards in the Array living_cards we'll use this to create a new card:
`living_cards.push(living_from_original(original));`

_More details are coming here soon !_




##Work flow

Construction is the game under construction with the latest upgrades. Production is the game that is playable with all testing and optimizing done. There will be no production version until the first beta.

###Cycles
1. Construction
    1. Change file(s)
    2. Commit changes
    3. Go to 1.
2. Production
    1. Copy the construction branch
    2. Make sure all tests pass
        * [Microsof Site Scan](http://modern.ie/en-us)
        * [W3C HTML Markup Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org/)
        * [JavaScript check with jslint](http://jslint.com/)
    3. Reduce the size of all medias to optimize speed
        * [CSS minifier](http://cssminifier.com/)
        * [Yslow rules](https://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html)
    4. Minify all text files
    5. Send to the public servers
    6. Wait until the construction branch has made significant changes and go to 1.

###File naming

All files and folder except special ones should be named with 0 space and with lowercase and linked with underscores ( _ ) . They should end with their appropriate extension (.html , .css , .md , .png). A valid filename can be __spell_cards.js__
JavaScript files containing a single object should have the same name as the object.
